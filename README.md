<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project

<b>Project</b>: Design to address the [Enefit Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-energy-behavior-of-prosumers) on the modeling of production and consumption in Estonia. 

<b>Objective</b>: Provide predictions for the production and consumption of clients in Estonia over a 4-day period.' To accomplish this, we opted to use two machine learning models: the Autoarima and the Prophet models.

<b>User journey</b>: The user select through a web page coded with Streamlit several parameters: date, business or individual, county, product type, and model. 
The API initiates a request to the Google platform, extracting the required dataset through BigQuery. The data is then preprocessed and fed into the selected model. 
Finally, the predictions for the next four days are displayed through graphs on the streamlit to the user.
